This bot is used to store information about users on whether they have wathced a movie/tv show.
This is my second version of the bot. This version is using The Movie Database's (TMDB) api to get all the infomation on the movies and tv shows. I am also going to the api to store what movies and tv shows a user has watched. A user will have to setup an account with TMDB for they can use all the features of this bot.
