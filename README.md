[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/e3c376fc993e4f83be2025b68c467666)](https://app.codacy.com/app/Jacob212/Marvin-Bot-TMDB?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=Jacob212/Marvin-Bot-TMDB&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

This bot is used to store information about users on whether they have wathced a movie/tv show.
This is my second version of the bot. This version is using The Movie Database's (TMDB) api to get all the infomation on the movies and tv shows. I am also going to the api to store what movies and tv shows a user has watched. A user will have to setup an account with TMDB for they can use all the features of this bot.
